## UNO Basics:

UNO is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people across the globe. The game was originally developed in 1971. <br>
The main objective of UNO is to be the first player to play all your cards. UNO is a game that blends elements of strategy <br>
with a touch of luck. A standard UNO deck consists of 108 cards. These cards are divided into four colors: Red, Yellow, Green, <br>
and Blue `(depicted as R, Y, G, B in-game)`. Each color has numbers from 0 to 9, as well as special action cards.<br>
In this version of the game, we'll be using numeric values along with their color (eg: R10 = Red Skip)
The special cards are:
   - Skip           (depicted as 10)
   - Reverse        (depicted as 11)
   - Draw Two       (depicted as 12)
   - Wild card      (depicted as 13)
   - Wild Draw Four (depicted as 14)
<br>

### Setup:


1. First shuffle the deck of cards and deal 7 cards to each player.
2. Next place the remaining deck face down on the table to form the draw pile.
3. Finally, turn the top card from the draw pile face up next to create a discard pile and start the game.

### Gameplay:


- First, the players take turns playing a card that matches the top card of the discard pile in either color or number.
- If a player cannot play the card they have, they must draw a card from the draw pile. If that card can be played, they may play it immediately. Otherwise, their turn comes to an end.
- When special action cards are played they create unique effects like:
- `Skip`: skipping next player's turn
- `Reverse`: reversing the order of play
- `Draw 2`: forcing the next player to draw 2 cards and forfeit their turn.
- `Wild`: Allows players to change the color of the card to be played.
- `Wild Draw 4`: Similar to the wild card but forces the next player to draw 4 cards and forfeit their turn.
- The first player to play all their cards wins.
